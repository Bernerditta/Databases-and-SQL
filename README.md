# 🌍 World Database SQL Project: Mastering Databases with SQL 🚀

## 🎯 Project Overview
In this project, I dived into the **world.db SQL dataset** to create a fully functional database 🛠️. I wrote and executed SQL queries 🖋️, debugged SQL code ⚡, and even built an **EER Diagram** to visualize relationships between the tables. I also explored primary and foreign keys 🔑 to understand the structure better and strengthen the database design.

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills
### SQL Magic: 🧙‍♂️
- **SQL Queries**: Wrote and executed complex SQL queries using common SQL functions like `SELECT`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and `WHERE`.  
- **SQL Debugging**: Debugged SQL queries to identify and fix errors, optimizing them for better performance.  
- **EER Diagram**: Designed an **Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) Diagram** to map out the relationships between tables in the database.  

### Key SQL Functions Used:
- 📝 `SELECT`: Retrieve data from one or more tables.
- 🔗 `JOIN`: Combine rows from multiple tables based on related columns.
- 🛠️ `WHERE`: Filter records based on conditions.
- 💡 `GROUP BY`: Group rows that have the same values into summary rows.
- 🔄 `ORDER BY`: Sort the result set in ascending or descending order.
- ✨ `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, `SUM()`: Perform aggregate functions.
